# IAM Basics

### Roles
Named collections of permissions (e.g., Editor, Viewer, Admin) applied to a resource or resource group.

### Resources
A URI-based reference to something you want to protect (e.g., /project/42, /user/1234/files/5678).

### Permissions
Actions that a role allows (e.g., read, write, delete).

### Assignments
Attach a role to a user (or API key) on a specific resource.

### Inheritance
Permissions are *automatically inherited* from parent resources.
